# Performance and Risk Analysis of Daily Returns

## üìä Project Description

This repository contains a Python script that performs a comprehensive performance and risk analysis of a financial asset's daily returns. The goal is to calculate and visualize key metrics critical to investment decision-making, such as volatility, skewness, kurtosis, and the Sharpe Ratio.

## üìà Metrics and Analysis

The script generates a number of visualizations and metrics, including:

* **Descriptive Statistics:** Mean, median, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis.
* **Frequency Distribution:** A histogram showing the distribution of daily returns, overlaid with a normal density curve for easy comparison.
* **Sharpe Ratio:** Calculation of the Sharpe Ratio to measure risk-adjusted asset performance, using an appropriate risk-free rate.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and Tools

* **Python 3.x**
* **Pandas:** For managing and manipulating time series data.
* **NumPy:** For efficient numerical calculations.
* **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** For creating clear and professional visualizations.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** The code is structured in a notebook for easy exploration and presentation of results.

## üöÄ How to Use the Code

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/tu-usuario/nombre-del-repositorio.git](https://github.com/tu-usuario/nombre-del-repositorio.git)
    ```
1.  Install the necessary libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
    ```
2.  Open the Jupyter notebook (`analisis_retornos.ipynb`) and executes the cells.

## üß† Demonstrated Skills

This project demonstrates my ability to::

* Perform financial data analysis with Python.
* Use data science libraries for statistical calculations and visualization.
* Interpret risk and return metrics (volatility, Sharpe Ratio, drawdowns).
* Communicate complex findings clearly through charts and reports.
* Develop end-to-end data analysis solutions.
